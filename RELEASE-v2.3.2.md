# Release v2.3.2 - MCP Protocol Compliance Fix

**Release Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Type**: Hotfix Release  
**Priority**: HIGH - Protocol compliance restoration

## üîß Critical Fixes

### MCP Protocol Compliance Restoration
- **FIXED**: Corrected `sendRequest` ‚Üí `request` method calls throughout codebase
- **FIXED**: Updated `MCPServerInterface` to proper MCP SDK protocol format
- **FIXED**: Type-safe elicitation response handling
- **IMPROVED**: Enhanced error handling for MCP protocol interactions

### Code Quality Improvements
- **CLEANED**: Removed redundant mcp-confirm directory from project root
- **FIXED**: TypeScript compilation errors (unused method warnings)
- **IMPROVED**: Proper elicitation workflow integration
- **ENHANCED**: Type safety in all MCP protocol interactions

## Technical Details

### Issues Resolved
1. **Protocol Method**: Incorrect `sendRequest<T>()` calls replaced with proper `request()` method
2. **Interface Mismatch**: `MCPServerInterface` updated to match actual MCP SDK specification
3. **Type Errors**: Fixed type casting issues in elicitation response handling
4. **Build Errors**: Resolved TypeScript compilation failures

### Security System Status
- ‚úÖ CONDITIONAL_DENY commands properly blocked (no execution)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Safety Evaluator functioning correctly
- ‚úÖ User confirmation workflow restored (when mcp-confirm available)
- ‚úÖ Fallback security behavior working as intended

## Deployment Impact

### Before Fix (v2.3.1)
‚ùå MCP protocol errors: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parse')`  
‚ùå TypeScript compilation failures  
‚ùå Incorrect elicitation method signatures  

### After Fix (v2.3.2)
‚úÖ Clean MCP protocol compliance  
‚úÖ Successful TypeScript compilation  
‚úÖ Proper security command blocking  
‚úÖ Stable operation without protocol errors  

## Known Issues (Post-Release)
- Minor server log warnings may persist (non-critical)
- Elicitation UI requires proper mcp-confirm server configuration
- Performance optimizations pending for future releases

## Testing Summary
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS
- ‚úÖ CONDITIONAL_DENY blocking: VERIFIED
- ‚úÖ Security system integrity: CONFIRMED
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol compliance: RESTORED

## Upgrade Recommendation

**IMMEDIATE UPGRADE RECOMMENDED** from v2.3.0/v2.3.1:
- Resolves critical MCP protocol incompatibility
- Eliminates parse errors in elicitation system
- Ensures security system functions as designed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy v2.3.2 to restore protocol compliance
2. **Short-term**: Address remaining server log warnings
3. **Medium-term**: Enhanced elicitation UI/UX improvements
4. **Long-term**: Performance optimization and advanced security features

**Note**: This release focuses on protocol compliance and stability. All core security features are functional and commands requiring confirmation are properly blocked.
