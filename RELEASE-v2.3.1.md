# Release v2.3.1 - Emergency Hotfix

**Release Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Type**: Hotfix Release  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Immediate deployment required

## üö® Critical Fixes

### Enhanced Safety Evaluator - MCP Elicitation Protocol Repair
- **FIXED**: MCP elicitation request parsing error (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parse')`)
- **FIXED**: Incorrect `sendRequest` method implementation causing protocol failures
- **IMPROVED**: Simplified elicitation message format (user feedback-driven)
- **IMPROVED**: Reduced complexity in security confirmation dialogs

## Technical Details

### Issues Resolved
1. **Protocol Error**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parse')` in MCP SDK interaction
2. **Method Signature**: Corrected `sendRequest<T>()` type definition and usage
3. **Message Complexity**: Reduced verbose security confirmation messages to essential information

### Code Changes
- Enhanced Safety Evaluator elicitation method signatures corrected
- MCP protocol compliance restored for real user confirmation
- Simplified message format: Command display + Yes/No + Optional reason field
- 3-minute timeout maintained for user responses

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix (v2.3.0)
‚ùå CONDITIONAL_DENY commands caused fatal MCP protocol errors  
‚ùå Elicitation system completely non-functional  
‚ùå Security decisions falling back to unsafe defaults  

### After Fix (v2.3.1)
‚úÖ MCP elicitation requests properly formatted and parsed  
‚úÖ User confirmation workflow functional  
‚úÖ Security system properly blocks dangerous commands pending user approval  
‚úÖ Clean error handling with actionable feedback  

## Deployment Priority

**IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED**

- Previous v2.3.0 release contained broken elicitation implementation
- Security system partially compromised in production environments
- User experience severely degraded for any CONDITIONAL_DENY commands
- Hotfix restores intended security behavior

## Testing Summary

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ MCP protocol interaction corrected
- ‚úÖ Elicitation message format validated
- ‚úÖ Error handling improved

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Deploy v2.3.1 to resolve critical elicitation failures
2. **Short-term**: Add language localization for elicitation messages
3. **Medium-term**: Enhanced user experience improvements for security confirmations

**Note**: This is an emergency hotfix release to restore functionality that was inadvertently broken in v2.3.0. All users should upgrade immediately.
